    * dataHash() Hashed result includes random salt.  However, this function maintains result length as if no salt is included.
    *
    * $saltLength is length of salt. It's caped by method you use to hash, so in case you use sha1, you can pass value 100,
    * but it will still use 40 characters.
    *
    * $hashingMethod defines which method you want to use to hash plain text since this function is build using hash().
    *
    * Quick example:
    * Hashing a password - dataHash($plain_password);
    * Validating password - dataHash($plain_password, $hashedPassword);
    *
    * @access public
    * @param {string} $target The string you want to hash (e.g. password).
    * @param {string} $targetHashed The target string hashed at an earlier time.  This would be hashed data in the database that is passed in for
    * comparison to the target string.  When targetHashed is not passed it, it is NULL and the target is hashed with a random salt.
    * When targetHashed is not null, targetHashed becomes salt and if target is valid, it will return same hash as targetHashed.
    * @return {string}
